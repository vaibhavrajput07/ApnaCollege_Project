I created this project while learning a full-stack web development course.
This is the Wanderlust web project developed using front-end technologies, back-end technologies, and a database.
This project is very helpful for people who are searching for rooms and hotels to stay. The website helps them find suitable rooms and hotels. 
This project is for both room owners and hotel owners, allowing them to upload their rooms and hotel details on the website, helping travelers find their desired destinations.

For the front-end, I used EJS templates for rendering forms and pages, along with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. For the back-end, I used Node.js and Express.js. The database is MongoDB.
In this project, I created different modules as per the requirements.
In this project, both client-side and server-side validation are handled.
